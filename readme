Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

We used 3 late days on this assignment. Even though we knew what we 
were doing, the debugging process took days. It is the hardest assignment
so far but rewarding.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

This was a fun assignment but tedious as well. It exposed me to program
modularity, design and debugging. I learnt that without a good design 
structure and plan, your implementation takes longer to become bug-free. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

N/A

What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

      Finished checking --- 12 code warnings
   

All the modules in Node_DT.h have been defined in NodeDGood.c,so we disagree 
with the warnings pertaining to module definition.

We used CheckerDT_Node_isValid in the client dtGood.c.

What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."


Checking checkerDT.c

   checkerDT.c: line 53: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pRealCount' through an assert?

   checkerDT.c: line 79: low priority:
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

   checkerDT.c: line 84: low priority:
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

We don't want to validate 'pRealCount' through an assert because sometimes we might 
not want the number of nodes in the DT.

What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

Variable ulIndex used is before definition because we did not set it but was set
in DynArray_bsearch.

      The pvContent and newContent can be null, so we don't want to validate 
      assert.

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        BDT_insert()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        BDT_freeSubtree()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        BDT_addChild()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4        BDT_strlenAccumulate()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5        BDT_findNode()
===============================================================

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

Critique for nodeDTGood.c and nodeDT.h
i. Node_compareString() in the implementation was unnecessary since 
Path_compareString could suffice. 

ii. Node_compare() in the implementation was unnecessary since 
Path_comparePath could suffice. 

iii. DT_insert() in dtGood.c is really long and can be broken into 
smaller helper functions. We can make the while a separate helper 
function.

iv. Path_prefix() in path.c is also long and we can break the for 
loop as a helper function.

v. Node_new() in nodeDT.h is not consistent because node comes before
path in the other arguments but path comes before node in this function.
